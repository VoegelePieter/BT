GitHub Copilot: ### Plan

1. **HTML Form**: Create an HTML form to allow users to upload an image file.
2. **PHP Script**: Write a PHP script to handle the file upload.
   - **File Validation**:
     - Check if the file is a valid image (JPEG or PNG).
     - Ensure the file size does not exceed 5MB.
   - **File Storage**:
     - Move the uploaded file to a specified directory on the server.

### HTML Form

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Image Upload</title>
</head>
<body>
    <form action="upload.php" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
        <label for="file">Choose an image to upload (JPEG or PNG, max 5MB):</label>
        <input type="file" name="file" id="file" accept="image/jpeg, image/png" required>
        <button type="submit">Upload Image</button>
    </form>
</body>
</html>
```

### PHP Script (upload.php)

```php
<?php
// Directory where the uploaded files will be saved
$target_dir = "uploads/";

// Ensure the uploads directory exists
if (!is_dir($target_dir)) {
    mkdir($target_dir, 0777, true);
}

// Check if the form was submitted
if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] == 'POST') {
    $file = $_FILES['file'];

    // Check if file was uploaded without errors
    if ($file['error'] == UPLOAD_ERR_OK) {
        $file_name = basename($file['name']);
        $file_size = $file['size'];
        $file_tmp = $file['tmp_name'];
        $file_type = mime_content_type($file_tmp);

        // Validate file type (JPEG or PNG)
        $allowed_types = ['image/jpeg', 'image/png'];
        if (!in_array($file_type, $allowed_types)) {
            echo "Error: Only JPEG and PNG files are allowed.";
            exit;
        }

        // Validate file size (max 5MB)
        $max_size = 5 * 1024 * 1024; // 5MB in bytes
        if ($file_size > $max_size) {
            echo "Error: File size exceeds 5MB.";
            exit;
        }

        // Move the uploaded file to the target directory
        $target_file = $target_dir . $file_name;
        if (move_uploaded_file($file_tmp, $target_file)) {
            echo "The file " . htmlspecialchars($file_name) . " has been uploaded successfully.";
        } else {
            echo "Error: There was an error uploading your file.";
        }
    } else {
        echo "Error: " . $file['error'];
    }
} else {
    echo "No file uploaded.";
}
?>
```

### Explanation

1. **HTML Form**: The form uses `enctype="multipart/form-data"` to handle file uploads and specifies `POST` as the method.
2. **PHP Script**:
   - Checks if the form was submitted using `POST`.
   - Validates the file type using `mime_content_type()`.
   - Checks the file size to ensure it does not exceed 5MB.
   - Moves the uploaded file to the specified directory using `move_uploaded_file()`.
   - Provides feedback to the user based on the success or failure of the upload process.
